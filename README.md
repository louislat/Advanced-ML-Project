# Advanced-ML-Project
Comparison of Optimization Algorithms for Machine Learning and Deep Learning

The project contains the following files : 

* ModelImageClassification.py
* ModelNostalgic.py
* ModelRegression.py
* ModelTextClassification.py

There are also the notebooks with the .ipynb extension. 

The .py files must be in directory named src in the same directory as the Pyton working directory. 

First install the packages with the following command line : 

```
pip install torch torcheval keras tensorflow
```

### Experiment 1 Image classification

Import the packages in the import section.

Run the code in the Data section in order to load the datas. 

Then run the code of the cells of the following sections :

- First Model : Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - LeNet 5
- Performances of the Optimization Algorithms : MNIST Dataset


### Experiment 2 Text classification

Run the code in the Data section in order to load the datas. 

Then run the code of the cells :

-  Model : Multi-Layer Perceptron

- Performances of the Optimization Algorithms : IMDB Dataset

### Experiment 3 Regression

Import the packages in the import section.

Run the code in the Loading and prepocessing data section in order to load the datas. 

Run the code of the cells of the Model & Optimization algorithms section

### Experiment 4: Nostalgic Adam algorithm

Import the packages in the import section.

Run the code in the Data section in order to load the datas. 

Run the code of the cells of the following sections :

- First Model : Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - LeNet 5
- Performances of the Optimization Algorithms : MNIST Dataset
